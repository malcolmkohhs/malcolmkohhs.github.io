            Throughout my six years at ACSP, I was immersed in a values-driven environment 
             I received a comprehensive education that instilled in me 
            the <i>i</i>HOPEFUL principles (Integrity, Humility, Obedience, Perseverance, Empathy, Faithfulness, Unity, and Loyalty), which serves as my 
            moral compass in decision-making. The school played a pivotal role in shaping me into a creative learner, effective communicator and comunity collaborator.

            As a member of the Boys Brigade Contingent, I expanded my global awareness, fostering qualities such as community-spiritedness, personal
            mastery, and leadership. During this program, I was entrusted with the role of squad leader, an experience that honed various leadership 
            proficiencies and left a lasting impact on me. By the end of the Boys Brigade junior program, I had attained the esteemed gold award.

            During my four years at the School of Science and Technology, Singapore, I learned many new skills, including collaboration, critical 
            thinking, creativity, confidence and communication. I have also picked up technical skills such as Design and Programming. SST's 
            self-guided learning culture and values have helped me overcome many challenges outside of academics. I specialise in Computing+ as 
            part of the school's Applied Subject, which has taught me skills I can apply to solve problems through computational thinking. 
            <br>
            <br>
            SST has also allowed me to grow in my leadership through experiences such as being on the Upper Secondary House Committee and being 
            the Class Chairperson. Through these experiences, I have learned and changed the way I approach issues and communicate. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In SST, I was on the Floorball team, which has helped me grow physically and mentally. Floorball is a tiring sport; however, through 
            the years, I have learned to have a better work-life balance, where I can cope with my commitments and academics simultaneously. 
            Floorball has also helped me grow in my values, specifically unity and perseverance, which I can apply both on the court and in my daily 
            life.  
            <br>
            <br>
            I was also in the ICT Talent Development Program, SST Inc. In SST Inc., I was able to equip myself with new skills such as swift and 
            java programming and design thinking.
